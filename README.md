```Hey there welcome to this Full stack Chat App project made using MERN stack along with Socket.io . This project is a lot different from the other chat Apps you see on youtube, so this one is made from scratch
. In private messaging you have features like "DELETE FOR ME" , "DELETE FOR EVERYONE" , "SINGLE TICK" (indicating delivery of message when other user is offline . "NORMAL DOUBLE TICK" when the user comes online 
and all the messages get loaded the SINGLE TICK IS CONVERTED TO "DOUBLE TICK" , FURTHER UPON READING THE MESSAGE THE NORMAL DOUBLE TICK IS CONVERTED TO "BLUE DOUBLE TICK" , sounds cool right ?? 

Also I have added the last seen , online status and it also happens in Real-time 
```
